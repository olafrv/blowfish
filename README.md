# Implementing the Blowfish Cipher Algorithm in Java

The Blowfish cipher algorithm is a symmetric-key block cipher designed by Bruce Schneier. It operates on 64-bit blocks and supports key sizes from 32 bits to 448 bits. It is known for its efficiency and strong security.

## Usage
```bash
make
```
